# 🚆 Smart Train Scheduling & Traffic Management System

A system designed to automate train platform assignment and optimize railway traffic flow using intelligent scheduling algorithms. This project aims to improve punctuality, reduce delays, and enhance overall operational efficiency in real-world railway scenarios.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

This project focuses on building an automated platform-management and routing engine for trains. Instead of manually assigning platforms, the system uses real-time train data, track status, and priority rules to allocate platforms dynamically. The goal is to simulate realistic railway conditions and improve traffic management without requiring new infrastructure.

## 🔧 Core Features (Phase-1)

- ✔ Automatic platform assignment  
- ✔ Real-time conflict detection  
- ✔ Priority-based scheduling  
- ✔ Handling delayed trains or blockages  
- ✔ Scalable design to add more stations and tracks

## 🚀 Why This Matters

### How the system helps railway traffic management:
1. **Reduces congestion** by preventing platform conflicts.  
2. **Improves train flow** and reduces unnecessary waiting.  
3. **Minimizes human errors** using automated decisions.  
4. **Manages disruptions intelligently** such as delays or blocked tracks.

## 🧠 Technical Approach

- Graph-based station and track model  
- Dijkstra/A* for route computation  
- Priority queues for scheduling  
- Real-time state updates for disruptions  
- Extensible architecture for future AI/ML integration  

---

## 📌 Feasibility

The system is highly feasible because it uses:
- Existing station data
- Software-based optimization (low cost)
- Incremental deployment—no major infrastructure changes
- Can scale from single-station simulation to full network

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Suggested)

- Java + Spring Boot (backend)
- Graph theory + scheduling algorithms
- MySQL/PostgreSQL for data storage
- Optional: React/Angular frontend for dashboards

---

## 🎯 Future Scope

- Live delay adjustment
- Predictive maintenance using ML
- Multi-station coordination
- Optimization for freight vs passenger trains

---

## 📜 Project Goal

Build a fully automated platform allocation and routing system that improves efficiency, safety, and operational scalability—similar to modern railway traffic control systems.
